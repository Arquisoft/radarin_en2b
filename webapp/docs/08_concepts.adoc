== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Model

image:domainModel.png[] 

[options="header"] 

|=== 
| Name | Description 
| User | A user is identified by web id (users' pod <<pods>> id), its location (changes frequently as the user's position may change during the day) and an authentication key (HTTP <<http>> key - web). 
| Location | A location is composed by several characteristics. The development team has decided that the better way of saving it is as coordinates, with its longitude and latitude. The time the location is placed is saved too. 
|=== 


=== MongoDB data structure
As we need to store the information explained in the domain model but in a mongo database the information structure is different. The objects saved will follow the next pattern:

var user = {
    "webid": "https://in..../user/asdfg",
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [43.53573, -5.66152 ] 
    }
    "timestamp": ISODate("2021-02-21T22:26:00.000Z"),
    "authKey": "auth123456789"
}

The information described before is an example to understand the idea wanted to be explained. The location is GeoJSON Point <<geojson>> that corresponds with Gij√≥n's location. The timestamp corresponds with the time the document is written: "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z".

Y: year with four digits.
M: year's month with two digits.
D: month's day with two digits.
h: hour of the day in 24 hour format.
m: minute of the hour with two digits.
s: second of the minute with two digits.
It is possible to specify at millseconds level.

=== Design Patterns 
We will use a MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. The application will be splitted  into services (logic and domain model), views and repositories. The user will interact with the controllers which will send back the corresponding views. The controllers will communicate also with the model. The model will interact with the repositories.  
We have wanted to use this architectural pattern in order to be able to distinguish the appearance, the business (logic) and the persistance. 
Using MVC pattern also allows us to make the changes easier or increase the functionality. 

=== Code Generation 
We will use a platform like React <<react>> to develop the web application and the mobile phone app. 

=== Security and Safety
****
Security is achieved thanks to various techniques:

* The usage of SOLID <<solid>> PODs <<pods>>, which protect all the compromising information. Only the user has access to the info.
* The application of HTTP <<http>> and REST <<rest>> protocols, that ensure we use secure communication channels, and the authenticity and integrity of the data sent. 
* Data validation, done by the app and the database, so that data is always consistent. 
****

****
Showing the location of a user is always a bit dangerous, so the app will always ask for permission to expose it. The user can hide their location at any time.
****

=== Plausibility Check and Validation 
When saving user's location the development team must check its coordinates in order to verify that they are correct and exist. 
The web application and the database used must check the datatypes of the information exchanged. 

=== Exception and Error Handling
The inconsistency of data and failed validation will lead to errors. These will be shown in the user interface as a message, so the user can understand what is happening and do something about it (for example, when logging in, if they have misspelled a word).
Technical errors, such as a breakdown, will not be handled. They can lead to losing data or a crash in the app.

=== Session Handling  
The session handling will be done using JavaScript <<javascript>> sessions. 

=== Testability
The application will be tested in several ways. We will develop unit tests, acceptance tests and load tests, which will be run automatically in a continuous integration <<contint>> server. This way we can be sure that our project works well.
