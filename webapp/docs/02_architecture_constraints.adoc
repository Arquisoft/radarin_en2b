== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

_In this section we will go through the different contraints the product has, giving them some kind of context and explanation._

=== Technical constraints
[options="header"]
|===
| Constraint         | Context / Motivation
| Implementation in Javascript     | The rest api will developed in the Javascript programming language, using Express as the framework and Node.js as the execution environment
| MongoDB used for database     | This NoSQL based technology will be used for storing data in a database. Mongose will be used to access this data
| Docker    | This container technology will be used for deploying the webservice, hence it will be needed
| Monitoring the app    | For this purpose we will use two technologies. For getting the data from the server every five seconds, we will have a piece of software of Prometheus. For displaying this data in a nice looking way Grafana will do the work
| OS independence   | No specific operating system will be needed in order to deploy the app
| Memory friendly   | The use of docker for deploying the app will make it a lighter app

=== Organizational constraints

| Constraint  | Context / Motivation
| Team      | Andrea García Cernuda, Hector Díaz Beltrán, Luis Fernández Suárez, Sara Rubín-Estrada Nora and Marcos Fernández González
| Time schedule     | The development started in february 2021 with due date at the end of april 2021
| Version control   | A public Github repository is available to check all the commits and version that this project has been through
| Testing       | Supertest technology will be used for this purpose

=== Conventions
[options="header"]
|===
| Constraint    | Context / Motivation
| Architecture documentation    | Based on arc42 version 7.0
