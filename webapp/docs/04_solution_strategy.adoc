.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.

To achieve the goals we have for this project, we have to take some decisions on how to approach the different problems we know that will appear during the development.

Technology decisions::
As we saw before, we have to adhere to some constraints regarding <<technology>> and <<organization>>. In order to do that, we have chosen some technologies that we think make the work much easier. Those would be:
|===
| Adaptable web application instead of a mobile application  |  This decision was made because we found a lot of problems when using React Native. The most troublesome was logging into SOLID <<solid>> that, although we managed to do it at the end, it was too late to apply it to the project and develop a complete mobile app.
| Monitoring: Prometheus <<prometheus>> and Grafana <<grafana>>  | For this purpose there are two technologies. There will be a piece of software from Prometheus <<prometheus>> that will get data every five seconds. To show this information in a nice looking way, Grafana <<grafana>> will do the work. Both functionalities and the corresponding results can be accessed by an admin account through the web app.
| Testing: Supertest <<supertest>>, E2E <<e2e>> and Gatling <<gatling>>  | Test the correct functionality of the app is vital. For this purpose we have chosen for the rest API <<rest>> Supertest <<supertest>> and for the webapp E2E <<e2e>> and Gatling <<gatling>>.
| React <<react>>, Express <<express>> and Node.js <<node>>  | In order to implement the app in Javascript <<javascript>>, we chose these technologies, that we believe will help us through the development.
| Google Maps API <<google maps api>> | The web app uses several maps to represent different things. Although we thought about using Leaflet <<leaflet>>, we finally decided to use the Google Maps (@react-google-maps/api library was the one finally chosen, after dealing with problems with react-google-maps) for showing the information as the development team had a little experience with it and found it easier to use.
| Notifications  | To use and deploy notifications the react-toastify framework was used.
| Login with inrupt <<inrupt>>  | To be able to log in the SOLID <<solid>> pods <<pods>> the @inrupt/solid-ui-react library was used.
| Docker <<docker>> and Heroku <<heroku>>  | Those technologies are used to have the different parts of the application inside containers. They could be found deployed in the cloud, in this case in Heroku <<heroku>>.
| Bootstrap <<bootstrap>>  | This framework allows the team to have a great variety of front-end components.
| Mongo database  | This is the final database chosen where the minimal information from the user is stored. It makes use of the Mongoose <<mongoose>> framework.
|===

Quality goals::
To achieve the <<quality>> goals:
|===
| Usability  | All interfaces are as easy as they can be so that it won't be a nightmare for non-experienced users. All options are accessed through the web app navigation bar so they are always visible.
| Security and Privacy  | Pods provided by SOLID <<solid>> will be our secure place to store user information.
| Mantainability  | During the development of the app, preparing it for future extensions or adding features to already existing ones will be a vital part as there is always room for improvement.
| Availability  | All users should be able to use the app whenever they want.
