== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain Model

image:domainModel.png[] 

[options="header"] 

|=== 
| Name | Description 
| User | A user is identified by their web id (users' pod <<pods>> id), location (changes frequently as the user's position may change during the day and the app updates it each 2 minutes), role (normal or admin) and a date that corresponds when the time the location was last updated. 
| Location | A location is composed by several characteristics. The development team has decided that the better way of saving it is as coordinates, with its longitude and latitude.
|=== 


=== MongoDB data structure
As we need to store the information explained in the domain model but in a mongo database, the information structure is different. The objects saved will follow the next schema:

    var user = {
        "webId": "https://pablo.inrupt.net/profile/card#me", // just an example
        "role": "Normal",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [43.354995, -5.851354] 
        },
        "updatedAt": "2021-05-01T20:37:25.240+00:00" // date and time
    }

The information described before is an example to understand the idea wanted to be explained. The location is GeoJSON Point <<geojson>> that corresponds with the Computer Science School of the University of Oviedo. There is a default role and an automatic date which corresponds with the time the document is written.

=== Code Generation 
We will use a platform like React <<react>> to develop the web application.

=== Security and Safety
****
Security is achieved thanks to various techniques:

* Login in a SOLID <<solid>> pod <<pods>> with OIDC authentication tokens.
* The usage of SOLID <<solid>> PODs <<pods>>, which protect all the compromising information. Only the user has access to the info.
* The application of HTTP <<http>> and REST <<rest>> protocols, that ensure we use secure communication channels, and the authenticity and integrity of the data sent. 
* Data validation, done by the app and the database, so that data is always consistent. 
* To achieve REST Api basic security CORS <<cors>> mechanisms are being used. 
****

****
Showing the location of a user is always a bit dangerous, so the app will always ask for permission to expose it. The user can hide their location at any time to stop sharing it with the application. If this happens the development team cannot grant the correct working of the application. A thing to highlight is that the last user location (the last one shared) is not deleted from the database.
****

=== Plausibility Check and Validation 
The user has few opportunities to introduce data manually in the application. 

The first case is when logging in. That validation is made by the SOLID <<solid>> providers; they check that the credentials introduced are correct.

The second case is when a user wants to create a tag taking the current location with it. The user can only write "inconsistent" names and descriptions to the tags, words that are not understandable, not more.

The location is picked from code so the coordinates are never wrong.

If the restapi were to receive incorrect data, like coordinates "imastring" only the request would fail, and the invalid data wouldn't be saved to the database.

The rest of the information cannot lead to errors or invalid datatypes.

=== Exception and Error Handling
As explained before user errors are not going to happen.

The only possible errors are system errors caused by bugs or errors in the implemented code.

Technical errors, such as a breakdown, will not be handled. They can lead to losing data or a crash in the app.

=== Session Handling  
The session handling will be done using JavaScript <<javascript>> sessions with React <<react>>. 

=== Testability
The application will be tested in several ways. We will develop unit tests, acceptance tests and loading tests; the first two will be run automatically in a continuous integration <<contint>> server. This way we can be sure that our project works well.
